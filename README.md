# Potions n' Poisons

A game that represents the consequences of making good or bad choices in life and the wisdom for turning lemons into lemonade.

An homage to Wolfgang Kramer, game designer extraordinaire.

## Rules

Players take turns rolling a die and moving one of their pawns as many steps as pips on the die.  A player may alternately move any neutral pawn that shares a spot with one of this own.  Pawns must always move forward.

If a player moves a pawn from a spot shared by no other pawns, he must collect the potion, poison or tome at his starting spot.  This will gradually shrink the path.  Potions have positive points and poisons negative points.  Each tome represents knowledge and allows the player who collected it to convert one of his poisons to positive points (e.g. -5 becomes +5).

A player continues taking turns while he has pawns on the board.  Eventally all pawns will exit.  When no player pawns remain, the player with the highest score wins.
