# Potions n' Poisons

A game that represents the consequences of making good or bad choices in life and the wisdom for turning lemons into lemonade.

It pays homage to [Wolfgang Kramer](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/7/wolfgang-kramer), a game designer who I consider one of the best.

## Rules

Players take turns rolling a die and moving one of their pawns as many steps as pips on the die.  A player may alternately move a guard (represented as a rook) if it shares a spot with one of his own.  Pawns and guards must always move forward.

Some spots will be occupied by a single pawn.  When the owning player advances it, he must collect the tile that it formerly occupied.  This is how players gain and lose points and the path gradually shrinks.  Potions have positive points and poisons negative points.  Each tome represents the knowledge to cure a poison bringing good from ill effect (e.g. -5 becomes +5).

Players continue taking turns while they have pawns.  Once all pawns exit, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins.

## Mindless Bots

When adding players, typing a name that starts with "Robo" or which ends in "bot" will yield a mindless bot player.  Bots will make valid moves but are devoid of intelligence.  

I am undecided as to whether I will add some in the future.  This deficit does, however, make the game child friendly.  It also works well enough with just two human beings.  I've played it with my daughter numerous times.
